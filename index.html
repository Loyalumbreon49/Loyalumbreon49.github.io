        <p>
          I want to cover my hands, but donâ€™t always want to deal with the heat or cloth disruption of gloves. 

          Persona: My persona is Jessica Simmons-Smith. She's a chef who is hard working and likes to butch, bake, and candle make. 
          For the gloves, Jessica wants something clean and environmentally friendly.
